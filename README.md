# Laniah-s-Flowers
For Laniah D'nay Cotton
I know your tired of hearing this and i know I hurt you through my actions, words, and the way I didn’t show up when you needed me. Looking back, I see how I could’ve handled things better and I hate that I made you feel anything less than loved, supported, and valued. The truth is losing you made me realize how deeply I care about you and how much you mean to me. What we had wasn’t perfect but it was real. And if I could go back and change the things I got wrong, I would in a heartbeat.
Im not asking you to forget what happened, or to pick up right where we left off. I’m asking for a chance a chance to rebuild trust, to grow, and to love you better than I did before. I want to show you not just say that I’ve learned from this.
Whatever you decide, I’ll respect it. But I needed you to know how deeply sorry I am, and how much I still love you.
